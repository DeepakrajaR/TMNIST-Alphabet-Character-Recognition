# TMNIST Alphabet Character Recognition

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for training a machine learning model to recognize alphabet characters using the TMNIST dataset. The project leverages deep learning techniques to classify handwritten characters accurately.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the TMNIST dataset, which is a variant of the MNIST dataset but includes alphabet characters instead of digits. The dataset consists of grayscale images of handwritten characters, and the goal is to classify them correctly.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and normalizing the dataset for better model performance.
- **Model Training**: Using deep learning frameworks to train a classifier.
- **Evaluation**: Assessing the performance of the trained model using various metrics.
- **Visualization**: Displaying dataset samples and performance metrics.

## Requirements
To run the Jupyter Notebook, install the required dependencies:
```sh
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib pandas scikit-learn
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd tmnist-alphabet-character-recognition
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook tmnist-alphabet-character-recognition.ipynb
   ```
4. Run the notebook cells sequentially to preprocess data, train the model, and evaluate results.

## Results
- The model is trained to classify alphabet characters with high accuracy.
- Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, and confusion matrices are visualized.

## Future Work
- Fine-tuning the model with different architectures.
- Expanding the dataset for better generalization.
- Deploying the model as a web-based application for real-time character recognition.
